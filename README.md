## description
This is a simple to-do-list which allows you to add, mark and remove your daily tasks.
It is made for educational purposes as a second JS's project and further HTML&CSS training.
To build this simple website, I used:
- ES6 features with immutability concept;
- the semantic HTML and the BEM methodology - for clear and structured references;
- cdn normalize and CSS (grid, basic transitions, media queries);
- OpenGraph tags.

## further development
Project will be evolving along with my programming skills. Probably, second version will be based on react framework.
Other ideas:
- added possibility of changing background-color with fancy switch button
- create functionality of switching between few lists

## inspiration/source
The exercise scenario with imposed apperance comes from the frontend course [YouCode](https://youcode.pl/) but is made by me.
